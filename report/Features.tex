\chapter{Dynamic features in Python}
As mentioned Python is a dynamically typed language, and therefore has a lot in common with JavaScript. 
In this section we present some of its interesting dynamic features, together with a selection of common runtime errors. 

\todo{Fix ref}
Classes are declared using the \inlinecode{class} keyword, supports multiple inheritance and can be modified further after creation. 
The code in Listing \ref{code:personExample1} declares an empty \inlinecode{Student} class that inherits from \inlinecode{Person}, 
which in turn inherits from \inlinecode{object}. In line 14 a function \inlinecode{addGrade} is added to the \inlinecode{Student} 
class and in line 11 the attribute grades is set to an empty dictionary on the $s1$ object. Therefore we can call the \inlinecode{addGrade} 
function on the \inlinecode{s1} object without getting a runtime error. However, since we forgot to set the grades attribute on the $s2$ object, 
we get the following runtime error from line 13: \inlinecode{AttributeError:\ 'Student' object has no attribute 'grades'}. 

Notice that the receiver object is given implicitly as a first argument to the \inlinecode{addGrade} function. 
In case we had forgotten to supply the extra formal parameter \inlinecode{self}, the following runtime error would result from line 12:
\inlinecode{TypeError:\ addGrade() takes exactly 2 arguments (3 given)}. 

Another interesting aspect with regards to parameter passing is that Python supports unpacking of argument lists. 
For instance we could have provided the arguments to the \inlinecode{addGrade} function in line 12 by means of a dictionary instead: 
\inlinecode{s1.addGrade(**\{ 'course': 'math', grade: 10\})}.

\begin{listing}[H]
  \begin{minted}[linenos]{python}
class Person(object):
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name
class Student(Person):
  pass
s1 = Student('Foo')
s2 = Student('Bar')
def addGrade(self, course, grade):
  self.grades[course] = grade
Student.addGrade = addGrade
s1.grades = {}
s1.addGrade('math', 10)
s2.addGrade('math', 7)
  \end{minted}

We wouldn't be able to change line 11 into \inlinecode{s1['grades'] = \{\}}. This would result in the following error: 
\inlinecode{TypeError:\ 'Student' object does not support item assignment}, while trying to access \inlinecode{s1['grades']} would result in the following error: 
\inlinecode{TypeError:\ 'Student' object has no attribute '\_\_getitem\_\_'}. Instead it is possible to call the built-in functions 
\inlinecode{getattr(obj, attr)} and \inlinecode{setattr(obj, attr, val)}. 

But Python also allows the programmer to customize the behavior when indexing into an object by supplying special functions 
\inlinecode{\_\_setitem\_\_} and \inlinecode{\_\_getitem\_\_}, giving the programmer much more freedom. 
As an example consider the new Student class in Listing \ref{code:personExample2}. 
With this implementation we could set the grades attribute as in JavaScript: \inlinecode{s1['grades'] = \{\}}, 
and get the grade of \inlinecode{s1} in the math course by calling \inlinecode{s1.math} or \inlinecode{s1['math']}.

\begin{listing}[H]
\begin{minted}[linenos]{python}
class Student(Person):
  def __getitem__(self, name):
    return self.grades[name]
  def __setitem__(self, name, val):
    setattr(self, name, val)
  def __getattr__(self, name):
    if name in self.grades:
      return self.grades[name]
    else:
      return "<no such grade>"
\end{minted}
