\chapter{Results}
During our project we have developed a type analyzer for Python, which is able to analyse simple Python programs. In this section we present some small, but non-trivial to analyze, programs together with the results of our type analyzer. We aimed to be able to support simple use of the magic method \inlinecode{\_\_getattr\_\_}, as we found that all uses of it in the web framework Django\cite{django} were simple.

In order to do so we needed to handle among others simple use of exceptions. Consider the following calculator example that makes use of exceptions:

\begin{listing}[H]
	\begin{minted}[linenos]{python}
def calculator(a, op, b):
	if (op == "+"):
		result = a + b
	elif (op == "-"):
		result = a - b
	elif (op == "*"):
		result = a * b
	elif (op == "/"):
		result = a / b
	else:
		raise Exception()
	return result

try:
	amodb  = calculator(10, "%", 20)
except:
	err = "An error occured"
	\end{minted}
\end{listing}

For this example our analyzer will conclude that \inlinecode{amodb} is undefined, and that \inlinecode{err} is "An error occurred". Due to a very simple path sensitivity our analyzer does not conclude that \inlinecode{amodb} is either undefined, \inlinecode{a}+\inlinecode{b}, \inlinecode{a}-\inlinecode{b}, \inlinecode{a}*\inlinecode{b} or \inlinecode{a}/\inlinecode{b}. If we had instead called \inlinecode{calculator(10, "+", 20)} our analyzer would correctly conclude that the result of the function call would be 30.

The simple exception handling has allowed us to handle implicit \inlinecode{\_\_getattr\_\_} calls. Consider part of the \inlinecode{Student} example from section \ref{Features} about dynamic features that uses the magic method \inlinecode{\_\_getattr\_\_}:

\begin{listing}[H]
	\begin{minted}[linenos]{python}
class Student(object):
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name
  def __getattr__(self, name):
    if name in self.grades:
      return self.grades[name]
    else:
      raise AttributeError()
a = Student('John')
a.grades = { 'math': 'A' }
try:
	mathgrade = a.math
except:
	err = "Error"
	\end{minted}
\end{listing}

Our tool is able to analyse this program and conclude that \inlinecode{mathgrade} is either 'A' or undefined (the latter because we do a weak update in line 10 to \inlinecode{a.grades}). It should be mentioned though, that the lack of context sensivity destroys the precision very quickly because Python has a lot of implicit method calls, contrary to e.g. JavaScript.

Again however, it is important to stress that the fact that we only support a subset of Python, e.g. not the magic method \inlinecode{\_\_getattribute\_\_}, simplifies the situation as also mentioned in the section about magic methods, \ref{Magic methods transformation}.
