\chapter{Introduction}
Python is a dynamically typed, general purpose programming language that supports both object-oriented, imperative and functional programming styles. Python exploits a lot of its funtionality through Magic Methods (implicit method and function calls), this makes it harder to predict the outcome of simple statements and expressions.  \\
Because of its dynamic nature and little tool support it can be difficult to develop and maintain larger programs. In this report we present our work towards developing a conservative type analysis for Python version 2.7 in Scala.
