\chapter{Introduction}
Python is a dynamically typed, general purpose programming language that supports both object-oriented, imperative and functional programming styles. As opposed to most other programming languages Python is an indented language, with the intention to allow programmers to write more concise code. \\
Because of its dynamic nature and little tool support it can be difficult to develop and maintain larger programs. In this report we present our work towards developing a conservative type analysis for Python in Scala.
