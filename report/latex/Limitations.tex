\chapter{Limitations}

\subsection{Numbers}
The size of an integer in Python depends on the system your on. If your running python on a x64 machine you will be able to create integers in the interval $[-2^{63}-2;2^{63}-1]$, where on a x86 machine your integers would be limited to the interval $[-2^{31}-2;2^{31}-1]$. In our analysis we assume that our target machine is a x86 and the integers is then limited to 32-bits. This is also described in The Python Language Reference data model\cite{pyref.datamodel} in section 3.2.

\subsection{Language functionality}
Python is a general purpose programming language and quite popular, it has been developed and extended and holds a lot of functionality, some of these functionalities is not used that often. In our analysis we have decided to exclude some of these language functionalities;
\begin{itemize}
	\item With statements
	\item Lambda expressions
	\item Generator expressions
	\item Yield expressions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Magic methods}
Python uses magic methods to give the developer flexibility to do operation overloading on custom classes. These methods makes simple operations such as binary operations and unary operations hard to emulate in the control flow graph since its not just an operation but could actually be a method-call with potentially side-effects. \\
We have choosen to focus on the magic methods that is used when properties on objects is read. These methods is called \_\_getattribute\_\_ and \_\_getattr\_\_. A complete list and description on the magic methods can be found in The Python Language Reference data model\cite{pyref.datamodel} in section 3.4.
