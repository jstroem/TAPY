\chapter*{Abstract}
We present a proof of concept for doing type analysis for Python using the monotone framework. We present how some interesting language features are converted into control flow graphs (CFGs), and also how it is possible to dynamically extend a CFG with calls to the so-called magic methods during the analysis, in order to minimize the total CFG in which the analysis works on. Finally, we show that our type analyzer is able to analyze small programs that involves non-trivial language features that distinguishes Python from other dynamic languages, e.g. JavaScript.
