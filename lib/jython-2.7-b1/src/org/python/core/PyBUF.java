/**
 * This interface provides a base for the key interface of the buffer API, {@link PyBuffer},
 * including symbolic constants used by the consumer of a <code>PyBuffer</code> to specify its
 * requirements and assumptions. The Jython buffer API emulates the CPython buffer API.
 * <ul>
 * <li>There are two reasons for separating parts of <code>PyBuffer</code> into this interface: The
 * constants defined in CPython have the names <code>PyBUF_SIMPLE</code>,
 * <code>PyBUF_WRITABLE</code>, etc., and the trick of defining ours here means we can write
 * {@link PyBUF#SIMPLE}, {@link PyBUF#WRITABLE}, etc. so source code looks similar.</li>
 * <li>It is not so easy in Java as it is in C to treat a <code>byte</code> array as storing
 * anything other than <code>byte</code>, and we prepare for the possibility of buffers with a
 * series of different primitive types by defining here those methods that would be in common
 * between <code>(Byte)Buffer</code> and an assumed future <code>FloatBuffer</code> or
 * <code>TypedBuffer&lt;T&gt;</code>. (Compare <code>java.nio.Buffer</code>.)</li>
 * </ul>
 * Except for other interfaces, it is unlikely any classes would implement <code>PyBUF</code>
 * directly. Users of the Jython buffer API can mostly overlook the distinction and just use
 * <code>PyBuffer</code>.
